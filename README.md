# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Simulation study of cellular electric properties in heart failure**   
Priebe L, Beuckelmann DJ. _Circ Res._ 1998; 82(11):1206-23
[9633920](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9633920) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Patients with severe heart failure are at high risk of sudden cardiac death.
In the majority of these patients, sudden cardiac death is thought to be due
to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Alterations of the electric properties of
single myocytes in heart failure may favor the occurrence of ventricular
arrhythmias in these patients by inducing early or delayed
afterdepolarizations. Mathematical models of the cellular action potential and
its underlying ionic currents could help to elucidate possible arrhythmogenic
mechanisms on a cellular level. In the present study, selected ionic currents
based on human data are incorporated into a model of the ventricular action
potential for the purpose of studying the cellular electrophysiological
consequences of heart failure. Ionic currents that are not yet sufficiently
characterized in human ventricular myocytes are adopted from the action
potential model developed by Luo and Rudy (LR model). The main results
obtained from this model are as follows: The action potential in ventricular
myocytes from failing hearts is longer than in nonfailing control hearts. The
major underlying mechanisms for this prolongation are the enhanced activity of
the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, the slowed diastolic decay of the [Ca2+]i transient,
and the reduction of the inwardly rectifying K+ current and the Na+-K+ pump
current in myocytes of failing hearts. Furthermore, the fast and slow
components of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr) and I(Ks), respectively)
are of utmost importance in determining repolarization of the human
ventricular action potential. In contrast, the influence of the transient
outward K+ current on APD is only small in both cell groups. Inhibition of
I(Kr) promotes the development of early afterdepolarizations in failing, but
not nonfailing, myocytes. Furthermore, spontaneous Ca2+ release from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers a premature action potential only in failing
myocytes. This model of the ventricular action potential and its alterations
in heart failure is intended to serve as a tool for investigating the effects
of therapeutic interventions on the electric excitability of the human
ventricular myocardium.
